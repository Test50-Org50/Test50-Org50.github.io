# C. Is it a Perfect Square?

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir perfect-square` to create a folder called `perfect-square`
- write `cd perfect-square` to go to the `perfect-square` folder
- write `code perfect-square.cpp` to create a file called `perfect-square.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given a non-negative integer \\(n\\). Your task is to determine whether \\(n\\) is a **perfect square**.

A number is a perfect square if there exists an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = n\\).

## Input

The input contains a single integer \\(n\\) (\\(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9\\)).

## Output

Print **YES** if \\(n\\) is a perfect square, otherwise print **NO**.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```text
25
```

**Output:**

```text
YES
```

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

```text
10
```

**Output:**

```text
NO
```

## Note

- In the first example, \\(25 = 5^2\\), so the answer is **YES**.

- In the second example, \\(10\\) is not a perfect square, so the answer is **NO**.

## Test Your Code
