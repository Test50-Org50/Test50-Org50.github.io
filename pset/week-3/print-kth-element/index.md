# A. Print K-th Element

## Problem Setup
- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir print-kth-element` to create a folder called `print-kth-element`
- write `cd print-kth-element` to go to the `print-kth-element` folder
- write `code print-kth-element.cpp` to create a file called `print-kth-element.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

Given an array of \\(n\\) elements and a number \\(k\\), your task is to print the \\(k\\)-th number of the array.

**Note:** The array is zero indexed.

## Input

The first line of input contains two integers \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) where \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^4\\) and \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\) — number of elements in array and \\(k\\)th element to find.

The second line of input contains \\(n\\) integers \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) where \\(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5\\) — elements of array.

## Output

Print the \\(k\\)th element of array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
6 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

**Output:**
```
2
