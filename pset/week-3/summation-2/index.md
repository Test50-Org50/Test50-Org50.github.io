# B. Summation

## Problem Setup
- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir summation-2` to create a folder called `summation-2`
- write `cd summation-2` to go to the `summation-2` folder
- write `code summation-2.cpp` to create a file called `summation-2.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

Given an array of \\(n\\) elements, implement a function that finds the summation of the array.

## Input

The first line of input contains an integer \\(n\\) where \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 1000\\), denoting the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains \\(n\\) integers separated by space, where \\(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 1000\\) — representing the elements of the array.

## Output

Output the summation of the array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
5
1 5 3 2 4
```

**Output:**
```
15
```

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
```
7
1 4 3 4 3 2 5
```

**Output:**
```
22
```
