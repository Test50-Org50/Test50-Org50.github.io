# C. One string

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir onestring` to create a folder called `onestring`
- write `cd onestring` to go to the `onestring` folder
- write `code onestring.cpp` to create a file called `onestring.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given two strings \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

Your task is to concatenate the strings \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and print the resulting string.

## Input

The input consists of two lines:

- The first line contains the string \\(A\\) (\\(1 \\leq \|A\| \\leq 1000\\)).
- The second line contains the string \\(B\\) (\\(1 \\leq \|B\| \\leq 1000\\)).

The strings \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) consist of lowercase English letters.

## Output

Print a single line containing the concatenated string \\( (A + B) \\).

## Example

**Input:**

```text
string
sheet
```

**Output:**

```text
