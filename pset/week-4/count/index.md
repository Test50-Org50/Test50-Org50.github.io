# D. Count

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir count` to create a folder called `count`
- write `cd count` to go to the `count` folder
- write `code count.cpp` to create a file called `count.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given a string \\(s\\) consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters, and a character \\(c\\). Your task is to count the number of times \\(c\\) appears in \\(s\\).

## Input

The first line contains the string \\(s\\) (\\(1 \\leq \|s\| \\leq 1000\\)), where \\(\|s\|\\) is the length of the string.

The second line contains a single character \\(c\\) (an English letter).

## Output

Print a single integer — the number of occurrences of \\(c\\) in \\(s\\).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```text
hello
l
```

**Output:**

```text
2
```

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

```text
programming
g
```

**Output:**

```text
2
```

## Note

In the first example, the character 'l' appears twice in "hello".

## Test Your Code
